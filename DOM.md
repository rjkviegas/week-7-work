## DOM

The Document Object Model is 
- the data representation of the objects that comprise the structure and content of a document on the web
- a programming interface for HTML and XML documents

It represents the document as nodes and objects, which can be changed by programs to alter the document structure, style and content.

The DOM is an object-oriented representation of the web page, which can be modified with a scripting language such as JavaScript.
