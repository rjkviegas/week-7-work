## What is a test?
A test does two things:

- Sets some conditions up.
- Checks that some things are true.

## What are testing libraries for?
A testing library supplies:

- Mocking functions to help isolate the part of the code being tested.
- Assertion functions that help check that specific things are true.
- A standard way to describe what a test or group of tests is doing.
- A way to organise tests.
- An easy way to run lots of tests.
